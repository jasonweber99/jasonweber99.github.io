subtitle: PhD student studying AI in CS Ed @ UCI
---
<p>Howdy! My name's Jason and I'm currently a PhD student at University of California, Irvine where my research focuses on the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and CS Education. While I do enjoy my research, I'm an educator at heart, TA-ing for introductory coding classes whenever possible. There's just something really special about guiding novice coders through their first term, from struggling to compile <em>Hello World</em> to venturing beyond coursework into personal projects :)</p>

<p>In my free time, I enjoy listening to audiobooks and podcasts, playing and making guides for certain video games, and sharing good food and drink with friends. I'm also always down to discuss pedagogy (or more accurately, andragogy) and code!</p>
