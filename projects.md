## Automatic Text-Labeling for Systemic Functional Linguistic Analysis
During my exploration of CS-specific language at Oregon State University, I focused my analyses solely on individual words or short word-phrases. This atomic look at language very likely fails to capture the broader stokes; that is if we look only at the individual words someone chooses, we lose context about how these words come together in a unique way. For example, while two professors of CS likely use similar words when teaching the same course, the way they structure these words, the way they formulate sentences, the way they establish tone, the way the "speak" may be quite different. Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) is a subfield of linguistics which provides a rigorous approach for a quantitative analysis of text that answers our problem.

In order to conduct an analysis based on SFL principles, labor-intesive text-labeling is required. This provides an obstacle to scaling analyses up to sizes that are statistically generalizable. I'm working on an AI model could be created and trained to accurately label text for SFL analysis, which when completed would allow for smaller research teams to get generalizable results. I could then use this model continue my exploration of CS-specific language.
