### AI in CS Education
While there has been a lot of hype and concern around the effects that LLMs like ChatGPT will have on higher-education, it is still unclear how students are really using these new AI tools. My interest is two-fold: I want to understand how students currently perceive LLM AI tools as they pertain to their educations and careers, as well as how to teach students to best use ChatGPT in an ethical and effective manner.

### The Discipline-Specific Language of CS
The academic field of CS contains both unique terminology and language patterns. My exploratory research aimed to identify a baseline set of CS-specific words that we could then use to analyze whether or not the usage of this language affects student understanding and academic performance. Our research was limited solely to CS-specific words. As a [personal side-project](../projects), I am trying to expand this exploration to consider larger parts of speech, not just the atoms of language: words.

### Childsplay: A novel approach to teaching K-12 computing through play
The [Childsplay](https://research.engr.oregonstate.edu/childsplay/) approach consists of two curricula that teach computing concepts to young students through the playing and analysis of board games. The first curricula takes an "unplugged" approach, teaching students beginner computing concepts without the use of any computers. The second utilizes a Domain-Specific Programming Language, BoGL (Board Game Language), to solidify the concepts learned in the first curriculum. I developed curriculum, managed a group of undergraduate researchers, observed live 6th and 7th grade classrooms, and applied mixed-methods analyses to our student survey results.

### Testing Tutor
For industry-bound students, software testing is a vital part of CS Education, however, current educational and industry tools lack inductive learning approaches, leading to trial-and-error behavior from students. The Testing Tutor web platform identifies the testing concepts attributable to students' missing test cases and provides personalized feedback via a customizable feedback engine. My team focused on building the subsystems to support the Python and C# languages.
